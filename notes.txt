I think we could do something interesting with films that have won oscars.
Especially would be interested in best actres/supporting actress category.

This just has a shit ton of movies on it. 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/top-1000-highest-grossing-movies
This is the top 1000 highest grossing movies. 

Potential Next Steps:
1. Clean data
    Figure out which datasets we want to begin with and make it into a data frame?

2. Look at which characteristics have strongest correlation, if any? 
    Maybe just use basic regression analysis.
